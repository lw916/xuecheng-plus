2023-02-22 10:08:31,910 ERROR [main][_JULLoggerFactory.java:55] - DefaultObjectWrapper.incompatibleImprovements was set to the object returned by Configuration.getVersion(). That defeats the purpose of incompatibleImprovements, and makes upgrading FreeMarker a potentially breaking change. Also, this probably won't be allowed starting from 2.4.0. Instead, set incompatibleImprovements to the highest concrete version that's known to be compatible with your application.
